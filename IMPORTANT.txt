A big change to the structure and architecture of the Loqui web app will be happening. There will be slight change in the layout and flow of the application
in order to make a more seamless experience for users. Google authentication will be removed to make the application more accessible and easier to access.

These changes will make the application more stable, and more scalable for the future.

A couple of integrations planned for Loqui include:

-   Socket.IO (For improved and more efficient real-time messaging capabilities)
-   WebRTC (For support of video and voice communication in the future)
